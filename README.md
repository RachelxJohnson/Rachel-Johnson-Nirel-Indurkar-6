The review page is not updating from what we have in our XAMPP, so when we updated our XAMPP files, it would not update on GITHUB, so there are some PhP files that don't work well here, but they work during thepresentation. Additionally, some of the hrefs in the nav bars are not updating, so they are not working (they work during presentation but don't update to Github. (You asked us to write this here because we weren't sure why this was happening).

Dear Mr. Millard,

Hope you are doing well, we miss you very much and hopw you are feeling generous while you read this and grade our website.
IMPORTANT: Our linking between pages issue is fixed. Our PhP page does work, but we had some problems updating the PhP to Github, so it might show up as an error on your side. However, you said that this was okay because you worked with us on our PhP. You know that it works, and so you said that it was fine that it might show up as an error, and stated that you would not take off any points for this. We hope you enjoy our website that we spent many, many hours on and we put our souls into this (we know you know this). Merry Christmas, have an incredible break.

Your favorite students,
